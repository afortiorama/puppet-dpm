puppet-dpm module
======

The puppet-dpm module has been developed to easily set up a DPM installation via puppet.

It relies on several puppet modules, some of them developed @ CERN and some others available from puppetforge.

It can be used to set up different DPM installations :

 - DPM Headnode ( with or without a local MySql DB)
 - DPM Disknode
 - DPM Head+Disk Node 
 -
